After more than 5 years of work, The Coalition is excited to announce the release of nearly two decades worth of data on California elections in several formats including a new open-source standard. This information, previously [blocked](https://www.californiacivicdata.org/2015/03/15/closed-data/) from public release by state officials, is now updated daily [on this site](https://calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/downloads/latest/).

This marks a major milestone in the Coalition's effort to make it easier for reporters and researchers to explore money in California state politics. The new data catalogs every candidate, ballot measure and election found in the jumbled, dirty and difficult governoment database tracking money in state politics.

You can find our new data release on [our revamped download page](https://calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/downloads/latest/).

### How we added election,race and ballot measure data

The source data comes from [CAL-ACCESS](http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov), the California state government's system for tracking the money political campaigns raise and spend on elections.

Much to our disappointment, the [bulk exports](http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/cal-access-resources/raw-data-campaign-finance-and-lobbying-activity/) of CAL-ACCESS data released by Secretary of State Alex Padilla, while containing some useful information, don't include coherent and complete lists of elections, races, public offices, candidates or ballot measures.

To be clear, __this information does reside in CAL-ACCESS__. It's displayed on their website and outlined in the database schema. When we asked Padilla's office to include these tables in their bulk data releases, they said "no."

That left us with only one option: Scraping it off the state's site.

Thankfully, the Coalition's student developer, [Sahil Chinoy](http://sahilchinoy.com/), was up to the task. He expanded on [earlier contributions](https://www.californiacivicdata.org/2015/02/17/opennews-scrapers/) to our project to train a computer script to navigate through the CAL-ACCESS website and parse the essential data out.

His work is now available as a stand-alone application written in the Django web framework. Download our [package from PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-calaccess-scraped-data), plug it into your project, [read our docs](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/apps/calaccess_scraped.html) and scrape away.

### How we improved our existing data

Look, CAL-ACCESS is a mess. And you don't have to take our word for it.

In [a recent public filing](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/922861435461410816), Padilla's office described it as an "old," "fragile" and "not well documented" system that "cannot be patched or modified" that's at risk of collapse.

Rather than force users to wade through its arcane data structures, we've modified our files to meet a new standard we authored with [Open Civic Data](https://opencivicdata.readthedocs.io), a community of leaders in our field aiming to define common schemas for consolidating public data.

OCD's ranks include Forest Gregg of [DataMade](https://datamade.us), James McKinney of [Popolo Project](http://www.popoloproject.com) and Rachel Shorey of [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com).

With their guidance, Coalition lead developer James Gordon wrote a [proposal](https://opencivicdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proposals/drafts/elections.html) outlining a new data schema for elections and related data types like candidates, contests and ballot measures. We then implemented those specs in Open Civic Data's Django application for any project (including yours!)

After many months of [back-and-forth](https://github.com/opencivicdata/docs.opencivicdata.org/pull/64) &mdash; and comments from our peers at Google, Socrata and elsewhere &mdash; python-opencivicdata version 2.0 was packaged and [released on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencivicdata).

Our hope is that this work can help power other open-source projects working with similar data sets in other states and countries.

### Who's already using this data?

Early versions of these files have been put to work by reporters at the Los Angeles Times.

[Maloy Moore](http://www.latimes.com/la-bio-maloy-moore-staff.html) and [Ryan Menezes](http://www.latimes.com/la-bio-ryan-menezes-staff.html) have used the experimental release of our software (available to everyone on [GitHub](http://django-calaccess.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/)) to generate a series of pieces on the millions of dollars flooding the race to be California's next governor.

Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom leads the pack with more campaign contributions than all competitors combined, according to the tally in [their graphic, seen above](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-california-governor-2018-money/).

Their reporting has uncovered Newsom's connection to California's burgeoning [cannabis industry](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-newsom-cannabis-20170727-story.html), as well as his heavy support from [Hollywood](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-hollywood-money-governors-race-20170804-story.html).

Contrary to the candidate's environmentalist image, Times reporters have also documented how Newsom has curried favor from [controversial real estate developers in San Francisco](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-newsom-waterfront-governor-20170519-story.html).

### What we're doing next

As a companion to our work, Abraham Epton of [Socrata](https://socrata.com) has submitted a OCD proposal focused on standardizing [campaign finance filings](https://opencivicdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proposals/drafts/campaign_finance_filings.html) across states.

Our next mission is to implement Abe's ideas so we can churn out cleaned up files containing the valuable data on campaign committees, contributions and expenditures now locked inside of CAL-ACCESS and its Form 460 filings.
